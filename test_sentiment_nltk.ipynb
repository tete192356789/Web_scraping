Were here to help you go through this long and winding quest, which ultimately results in an important item you may want to have on hand near the end of the game.Find and speak with GowryTo begin Millicents questline, youll need to first speak with an old fellow named Gowry who hangs out in a shack in eastern Caelid along the road to Sellia, Town of Sorcery. Exhaust his dialogue regarding the Unalloyed Gold Needle hes seeking, then youll be off to the nearby swaps to retrieve it.Gowrys ShackDefeat Commander ONeilObtaining the Unalloyed Gold Needle requires you to take out Commander ONeil in the swamp just west of Gowrys shack. It wont be an easy fight, but you can check out our tips for taking him down to make things a bit less strenuous. Once hes dead and youve got the Unalloyed Gold Needle in hand, youre all set to return to Gowry.Commander ONeil locationVisit Gowry twiceReturn to Gowry and exhaust his dialogue once again, then fast travel to the closest Site of Grace and run back to him once more. After doing so, hell hand you the repaired needle and give you some insight into the secrets of Sellia, Town of Sorcery. Next up, youll be headed to the Church of the Plague to find Millicent and officially begin her questline.Speak to Millicent at the Church of the PlagueTo reach the Church of the Plague, youll need to fight your way through Sellia, Town of Sorcery by lighting all of the braziers and defeating the area boss. If youve managed to be teleported to the Beastial Sanctum at some point earlier in the game, you can also fast travel to that Site of Grace and go south to reach the church.Church of the PlagueOnce youre there, youll find Millicent. Give her the needle and then rest at the nearby Site of Grace to reset her dialogue. After speaking with her enough, shell eventually grant you the Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom talisman, and youll have wrapped up the first part of her quest. To continue, youll need to return to Gowrys Shack once more.Go back to Gowrys Shack yet againOn your next visit to Gowrys Shack, youll find that Millicent has now shown up and has some things to talk about. Exhaust her dialogue, fast travel away, then go back to the shack to see Gowry has returned. Exhaust his dialogue, too, and youll have completed the Caelid segment of Millicents story.Find the Valkyries Prosthesis at the Shaded CastleIn order to continue Millicents questline, youll first need to visit the Shaded Castle, which is far to the north settled between Mt. Gelmir and Altus Plateau. Fight your way through the area until you find a small room guarded by a Cleanrot Knight. Inside the room youll find the Valkyries Prosthesis, allowing you to advance Millicents dialogue in her new location of Altus Plateau.Shaded CastleSpeak with Millicent in Altus PlateauHead to the Erdtree-Gazing Hill Site of Grace in Altus Plateau and find Millicent standing just to the north of where you spawn. Give her the Valkyries Prosthesis, exhaust her dialogue. Next up, youll be headed to the north again to defeat and boss and speak with Millicent once more.Go to the Windmill Village and defeat the Godskin ApostleIn northern Altus Plateau is the Windmill Village, which is an area that features a fairly straightforward gauntlet of creepy enemies and the Godskin Apostle boss at the top. The Godskin Apostle is a challenging fight for lower-level characters, but he shouldnt pose a long-term problem once you get his attack patterns memorized.Windmill VillageOnce the Godskin Apostle falls, rest at the nearby Site of Grace. When you arise again, youll find Millicent standing around with more dialogue to exhaust. Do so, then youll have wrapped up the part of her quest that takes place in Altus Plateau. You wont find her again until youve found your way to the late-game area Mountaintops of the Giants.Speak to Millicent in the Mountaintops of the GiantsLate in the main story, youll gain access to the Mountaintops of the Giants. Millicent can be found next near the Snow Valley Ruins Site of Grace in this biome. She has a bit to say here, so exhaust all of her dialogue and then prepare to round up two halves of a medallion that are required to reach the Haligtree area.Find both halves of the Haligtree MedallionOne part of the Haligtree Medallion can be found at the top of Castle Sol after defeating Commander Niall in the northeast of the Mountaintops of the Giants. The other requires you to hit a strange pot located in the Village of Albinaurics in southern Liurnia of the Lakes. When you do, youll find that the pot was merely a disguise for a decrepit old man who will give you the other half of the medallion.Head to the HaligtreeOnce you have both halves, youll be in possession of the complete Haligtree Medallion. You can use this medallion at the Grand Lift of Rold--the same lift that took you to the first part of the Mountaintops of the Giants--to go down into a new frigid area of the biome.Ordina, Laturgical TownMake your way to the north of this new section and solve the relatively easy puzzle at Ordina, Liturgical Town (its very similar to how you completed Sellia, Town of Sorcery). Youll soon find your way to the Haligtree.Speak to Millicent at the Prayer Room Site of GraceAs you explore the Haligtree, youll eventually come to the Prayer Room. Near the Site of Grace will be Millicent, so speak to her and once again exhaust all of her dialogue. Shell stay in this spot until youve completed the next step. Youre almost done!Defeat the Ulcerated Tree Spirit near the Drainage Channel Site of GraceA bit further into the Haligtree, youll come across one of the loathsome Ulcerated Tree Spirit bosses everyone loves to hate. This monstrosity will be extra difficult due to the fight taking place in a pond that will inflict the Scarlet Rot status effect on you. If possible, fight him at range somehow by using the outer banks.Ulcerated Tree Spirit fightOnce the Ulcerated Tree Spirit is dead, rest at the Drainage Channel Site of Grace and prepare for another fight soon.Go back to where you killed the Ulcerated Tree SpiritHead back to where you just killed the Ulcerated Tree Spirit to find a yellow summon sign and a red summon sign. The former allows you to help Millicent fight off invaders in her world, while the latter gives you an opportunity to kill her.Choosing to kill her will net you the Millicents Prosthesis talisman, which boosts your Dexterity and successive attack damage a bit. But in most cases, youll want to choose the yellow summon sign to help her fend off an ambush.Kill the invadersChoose the yellow summon sign and help Millicent in a difficult encounter against four NPC invaders. At first glance, it might seem best to try to tank one or two and let her handle the others, but shell actually die fairly quickly if you do. Instead, help her fight her targets and keep the pressure on until all four invaders have perished. For your trouble, youll earn the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia talisman, which will boost your attacks with successive hits.Look for summon signs near here.Return to Millicent twice to wrap up the questAfter leaving Millicents world, go rest at the Drainage Channel Site of Grace again, then return to where you just fought the invaders to find Millicent. Exhaust her dialogue, rest once more, then come back a final time to find her dead. Looting her body will earn you the Unalloyed Gold Needle. You can use the needle at the flower that spawns in Malenias boss fight room after you defeat her to obtain Miquellas Needle, an important item that can be used in a specific place near the very end of the game to reverse the Frenzied Flame ending, should you so choose to do so.Elden Ring Guides  Elden Ring Rune Farming: The Best Early Areas To Level Up Fast What To Do First In Elden Ring: Best Route, Weapons, And Important Map Locations Elden Ring: Best Weapons You Can Find Early In Limgrave  + Show More Elden Ring Guides Links (7)  Elden Ring: How To Two-Hand Weapons And Why You Should Elden Ring Margit The Fell Omen Guide - Recommended Level And How To Beat The First Boss Elden Ring: How To Upgrade Weapons - Smithing Stones Explained Elden Ring Tips For Beginners: Learning The Ways Of The Lands Between How To Level Up In Elden Ring, Stats Explained Elden Ring: Best Keepsakes To Pick During Character Creation Elden Ring Map: Where To Find Your First Map Fragment   Elden RingFollow$59.99 on TargetBuyGameSpot may get a commission from retail offers.Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
