      "<p><b><a href=\"/wiki/Synthetic_diamond\" title=\"Synthetic diamond\">Synthetic diamond</a></b> is <a href=\"/wiki/Diamond\" title=\"Diamond\">diamond</a> produced in a technological process. Claims of diamond synthesis were documented between 1879 and 1928 but none have been confirmed. In the 1940s, research began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union to grow diamond using <a href=\"/wiki/Chemical_vapor_deposition\" title=\"Chemical vapor deposition\">chemical vapor deposition</a> (CVD) and high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT)  processes. The first reproducible synthesis was in 1953. CVD and HPHT  still dominate the production of synthetic diamonds, whose properties vary depending on the process used. The <a href=\"/wiki/Hardness\" title=\"Hardness\">hardness</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Thermal_conductivity\" title=\"Thermal conductivity\">thermal conductivity</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Electron_mobility\" title=\"Electron mobility\">electron mobility</a> of some manufactured diamonds  are superior to those of natural diamonds. Synthetic diamond is used in cutting and polishing tools, <a href=\"/wiki/Abrasive\" title=\"Abrasive\">abrasives</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Heat_sink\" title=\"Heat sink\">heat sinks</a>. Electronic applications of synthetic diamond are being developed, including high-power <a href=\"/wiki/Switch\" title=\"Switch\">switches</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/Power_station\" title=\"Power station\">power stations</a>, high-frequency <a href=\"/wiki/Field-effect_transistor\" title=\"Field-effect transistor\">field-effect transistors</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Light-emitting_diode\" title=\"Light-emitting diode\">light-emitting diodes</a>. Both CVD and HPHT diamonds can be cut into gems and produced in  various colors <i>(pictured)</i>. (<b><a href=\"/wiki/Synthetic_diamond\" title=\"Synthetic diamond\">Full article...</a></b>)\n",
